# Example dApps

## React dApp example

In the `packages/react-example-dapp/` folder, you can find a typescript React application that implements Plutonication.

### React dApp docs

A detailed description of the Plutonication implementation can be found:

1) https://plutonication.com/docs/react-example
2) in the `packages/react-example-app/src/app.ts` file.

### Docker

The following docker file runs the sample React dApp, which can be used for testing all plutonication dApp functionalities.

```
# !!! Do not forget to build Plutonication first before trying to run this example dApp !!!

# Navigate to the react example folder
cd packages
cd react-example-dapp

docker build -t plutonication-react-dapp-example . 

docker run -p 3000:3000 plutonication-react-dapp-example
```

### Run locally

```
# !!! Do not forget to build Plutonication first before trying to run this example dApp !!!

# Navigate to the react example folder
cd packages
cd react-example-dapp

# Install all dependencies
npm i

npm start
```

## Pure HTML dApp example

If you are interested in the pure integration, just take a look at the Pure HTML example dApp.

```
# Install all dependencies
npm i

npm run build-example-dapp
```

After the Plutonication has been built, just open the `packages/example-dapp/index.html`.

# How Plutonication works

The private key is always saved in your wallet on your phone and is never sent anywhere.

You need to pair the dApp with the wallet. To do so, the wallet needs to receive a special link with information needed to establish the connection. The wallet can receive this link, for example, by scanning a QR code. Once the link is received, the dApp and the wallet will get paired via websockets to establish a stable connection between different platforms. After the connection is established, the wallet is ready to receive any Extrinsics, which it can then sign and send back to the dApp.

To get a more in-depth details of the underlying backend, read this guide: https://plutonication.com/docs/flask-server.

# Testing

### Unit tests

The provided unit tests showcase most of the Plutonication capabilities.

```
# !!! Do not forget to build Plutonication first before trying to run this example dApp !!!

# Navigate to the tests folder
cd packages
cd tests

# Install all testing dependencies
npm i

npx playwright test
```

### E2E testing with Pluto wallet

Firstly, run the sample React dApp that can be used for testing.

Alternatively, you can also use the pure HTML example dApp that is deployed to [github pages](https://rostislavlitovkin.github.io/Plutonication/)

Then, you will need to get Pluto wallet on your phone. There are multiple ways to get it:
1) Download it from Google Play (for Android phones): https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rostislavlitovkin.plutowallet
2) Build and deploy it locally from this repo (for all platforms): https://github.com/rostislavLitovkin/plutowallet

After installation completes, click on the QR code scanner icon on the top-right corner of the screen to open the universal QR code scanner. Then scan the Plutonication QR modal and accept the connection. PlutoWallet and the dApp will successfully pair. PlutoWallet is now ready to receive any transaction requests.

If you are not sure about any of these steps, you can also follow this video guide, that showcases the whole process of connecting your PlutoWallet to the dApp and signing a transaction request: https://youtu.be/lVVcgNs7KRk?si=X_SohjoVUprai1r1
